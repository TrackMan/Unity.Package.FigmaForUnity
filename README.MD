## Overview

* AWESOME GIF FROM JASUR *

Have you ever dreamt about the magical button which would just get the design from UI-tool (Figma) and put it right to the Unity Editor without recreating all elements manually? Here it is - Figma for Unity allows you to put the designs from Figma documents to Unity and do multiple manipulations with UI elements via scripts.  

### Features
- Imports and parses figma pages into uxml/uss assets in Unity

## How to use

### Attributes

## TODO
- Cleanup figma parser. Regex.
- Known issues
- Roadmap
- Localization

## Limitations
- Main Frame should have a unique name
- Colors and Icons that we will reuse should be put into a separate frame (as rectangles)
- Vectors cannot be invisible, cannot have Image Fill, should be grouped into Union where possible
- Fills can only have one Fill per element
- Auto-Layout cannot have stroke borders
- Cannot mix horizontal center and vertical center elements within the same parent (will fallback to center-center)
- Circles should be implemented through rectangles instead of ellipses (for better visuals) ??? check

## Best practice
- Keep it stupid simple
- Hierarchy of elements should be as simple as possible and have proper naming (not Frame 4815162342)
